        <h>Insider Threat Detection</h>
        <p>
            When it comes to cyber threats, external hackers and malware often grab
            the headlines. Yet, some of the most damaging breaches begin from within
            an organization’s own ranks. Whether it’s a disgruntled employee deliberately 
            stealing data or a well-intentioned staff member accidentally exposing 
            sensitive information, insider threats pose a unique risk. AI-based insider
            threat detection systems offer a proactive defense by analyzing user behavior
            around the clock. They develop a “baseline” of normal activity, so any 
            sudden changes—like large file downloads at unusual hours or access attempts
            from unfamiliar locations—trigger an alert.

            At the heart of these solutions lies machine learning, which excels at finding
            subtle anomalies that might slip under the radar of traditional security tools.
            By correlating various data points—such as login frequency, file access history,
            and even communication patterns—AI can spot patterns that indicate a potential
            insider threat. When an anomaly surfaces, security teams receive detailed, 
            prioritized alerts, helping them investigate potential issues swiftly. This
            targeted approach not only helps catch malicious actions but can also highlight
            unintentional errors or policy violations before they grow into serious incidents.

            While AI delivers significant advantages in detecting insider threats, it isn’t 
            a complete replacement for human judgment and comprehensive security policies. 
            Ethical considerations, such as employee privacy and data usage consent, must be 
            factored into any monitoring program. Additionally, final decisions on disciplinary
            action or major security changes still rely on human oversight to balance organizational
            security with fair treatment. By integrating AI-driven monitoring with a culture 
            of clear communication and responsible data handling, organizations can significantly
            reduce the risk of insider threats without compromising trust or morale.
